### About

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Hello! I'm Priyansh Jain, a first-year student at Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law (RGNUL), Patiala.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> As a fresher, I'm still exploring what the law and the profession have to offer I am particularly intrigued by its interdisciplinary nature, especially how law intersects with policy, technology, trade, and society at large. While I currently have a keen interest in commercial and constitutional (socio-legal) law, I'm not committed to them as of yet and remain enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities. At present, I'm exploring the intersection of law and Victimology.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Other than Law, I often have flings with Literature and social sciences, especially Sociology and Economics.</p>
